## by (Yasmine Hussein)


## Dataset

> The U.S. Department of Transportation issued a final rule on reporting the causes of flight delays on November 25, 2002. The final rule followed two years of consideration.
> A flight is considered delayed when it arrived 15 or more minutes than the schedule (see definitions in Frequently Asked Questions). Delayed minutes are calculated for delayed flights only. When multiple causes are assigned to one delayed flight, each cause is prorated based on delayed minutes it is responsible for. The displayed numbers are rounded and may not add up to the total.
